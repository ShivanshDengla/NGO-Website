        <h1>Centre activities</h1>
    
        <p>The Centre was started on 1st August 1967, when Smt. Khorshed Gharda donated her property at Mount Abu, to the NAB (India) to start a Rehabilitation Centre for the Blind. At the time, it was the first centre of its kind in India. Since its formation it has rehabilitated about 1,500 adult visually challenged inmates of both sexes.

	Admission is given to fully or partially blind of both sexes from the age of 16 to 40 years, mainly from the Hindi-speaking areas of the country. It is a residential rehabilitation-cum-training centre providing lodging, boarding, education, training, clothing and casual medical treatment to blind students FREE OF CHARGE. Pocket money of Rs 45/- per month is given to all trainees. 

This Centre is recognised by central and state governments for the purpose of rehabilitation-education. The Educative programme at the Centre envisages education in adjustment and rehabilitation. Modern methodology and aids are being adopted by our staff to educate our clients so that they can develop self reliance and confidence with a view to living a normal life as self respecting citizens. 
</p>
        
        <p>The objective of the Centre is to impart skills and knowledge to the students to enable them to live a normal, productive life when they pass out from the Centre. Training in orientation and mobility, home economies and daily living skills and Braille and communication skills is imparted. Pre-vocational training and handicrafts are taught, such as chair re-caning, doormat weaving, motor rewinding/light engineering, book-binding, candle and chalk making, liquid soap and phenyl making.

Training is completed within a period of 18 to 24 months depending on individual interests and aptitudes.

Since 2002-03, a middle school attached to the Rajasthan Board from class 1st to 8th has been started. Visually challenged of both sexes from the age of 5 to 16 years are admitted and education is given through Braille books and audio aids.  

A Braille and audio library has been set up containing books for the Rajasthan Board, as well as general reading and general knowledge books.
</p>
        
        <p>A Work Centre for the Blind has been started to give an opportunity to the trained students to manufacture different items they have learnt to make during their training. This is to help them earn a livelihood, and become independent and self reliant when they return home.






The boom in information technology has provided large number of opportunities to everyone in seeking job, seeking information, and exploring the world in ways which they have never done so far. While the flap of opportunities has opened for everyone, those who are blind or visually impaired are also not destitute from it. With an idea of empowering blind persons through the power of information and technology and With the escalating demand of computer in every stratum of life, it’s must for a person to learn computer in today’s time to hunt for a grovelling job, to keep inform, and to live a better life. With an idea, that those who can not see must also not be destitute from it, a highly advanced computer centre and learning resource centre has been established   in the premises of NAB PNM Rehabilitation centre for the Blind, Mount Abu,  To enable visually impaired youngsters to keep pace with rapid changes in technologies and job-market requirements, we have taken utmost care that they can get opportunity to learn all the required skills which may lead them to live a well treasured and dignified way of life.
The said learning resource centre does not only teach computer, but a complete training in spoken English and personality development is also provided.

        <p>We have all the different Amenities which indemnify the superior quality of our course. These amenities consist of latest English and Hindi screen reader softwares, softwares for OCR technology, digital accessible information system, high tech computers and accessories etc.
	
We have started first Daisy Recording studio in Rajasthan to provide the study material in specialized Daisy format to visually impaired students. We have a Daisy books library at the centre containing approx 2000 books of various subjects and general reading in English/Hindi.

We are organizing the refresher courses in collaboration with the National Institute for the visually handicapped, Dehradun for the teachers/professional working in the special schools all over the country. We are organizing such courses for the last five years and it gives us more credibility. 
 
We have installed several solar street light and solar water heaters in our campus with the help of GAIL, INDIA. This centre is having a Dhaba training unit under the CSR program of SAIL, INDIA. This unit gives practical training in running a Dhaba to students so they may start their own business in their home town or village.
